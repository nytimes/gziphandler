// Push initiates an HTTP/2 server push. This constructs a synthetic
// request using the given target and options, serializes that request
// into a PUSH_PROMISE frame, then dispatches that request using the
// server's request handler. If opts is nil, default options are used.
//
// The target must either be an absolute path (like "/path") or an absolute
// URL that contains a valid host and the same scheme as the parent request.
// If the target is a path, it will inherit the scheme and host of the
// parent request.
//
// The HTTP/2 spec disallows recursive pushes and cross-authority pushes.
// Push may or may not detect these invalid pushes; however, invalid
// pushes will be detected and canceled by conforming clients.
//
// Handlers that wish to push URL X should call Push before sending any
// data that may trigger a request for URL X. This avoids a race where the
// client issues requests for X before receiving the PUSH_PROMISE for X.
//
// Push returns ErrNotSupported if the client has disabled push or if push
// is not supported on the underlying connection.
